# StackBreather Phase2

**StackBreather Phase2** is the unified breathing engine that links Core Breather and Field Breather outputs into a harmonized recursive stack cycle.

- Loops through 1–9 breathing phases
- Captures output from both core and field logic
- Logs breathing trace per cycle for synchronization
- Used for Phase2 runtime stack linking
