# ProtoForge Runtime – Frozen v1.05 (DB Enabled + Capacitor)

**Status:** Frozen  
**Freeze Date:** April 23, 2025  
**Version:** v1.05  
**UI Engine:** control_panel_ui_engine_frozen_v1.02  
**Base Runtime:** protoforge_frozen_v1.04_db_enabled  
**New Engine Integrated:** symbolic_capacitor_engine_frozen_v1  
**Diagnostic Tool:** run_system_test.py  

---

### System Highlights

- UI stack powered by frozen control panel v1.02
- Symbolic Capacitor integration — charge sourced from `resonance_sync.json`
- Capacitor engine logs to `charge_trace.log` and buffers charge range
- Symbolic Charge is now *dynamically buffered* and displayed in the UI
- ChristPing and drift monitoring are fully functional
- Runtime logs and field state monitored live
- Copilot panel placeholder (Gilligan) is visually live
- Layout is responsive and ready for recursion phase expansion

### Runtime Diagnostic Output

This version includes `run_system_test.py`, a full-stack symbolic diagnostic runner.

Example Output:


✅ Found: log ✅ Found: log/field_state.json → Phase: Φ7 → Charge: 72%

✅ Found: log/arbitration_log.jsonl → Drift Events: 2 → ChristPing Override: ⚠️ YES

✅ Found: log/protoforge_log.txt → Log lines present: 12 → Last line: System initialized...

✅ System test completed.

### Notes

This is the first runtime to use buffered symbolic charge instead of static field state.  
It represents the transition from symbolic input reflection → symbolic energy modulation.  
This version is suitable for recursive UI overlays, charge-aware log filtration, and integration of ChristPing reaction engines.

All inputs are sandboxed. No dynamic mutation occurs post-freeze.  
This version is stable for long-term symbolic recursion and Phase 9 expansion.
