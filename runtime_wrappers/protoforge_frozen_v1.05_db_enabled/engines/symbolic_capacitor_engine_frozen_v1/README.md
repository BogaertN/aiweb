# Symbolic Capacitor Engine

This engine simulates symbolic charge buffering for the AI.Web runtime.  
It randomly sets a charge value between 45–90% and logs both the JSON output and a trace log.

- `resonance_sync.json` → Charge % written here (for UI reading)
- `charge_trace.log` → Logs every simulated charge event
- `capacitor_core.py` → Run manually or on timer

Future versions will pull charge from recursive stack dynamics and symbolic intention events.
