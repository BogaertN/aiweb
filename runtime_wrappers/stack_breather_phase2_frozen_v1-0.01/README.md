# StackBreather Phase2

**StackBreather Phase2** is the unified breathing engine that links Core Breather and Field Breather outputs into a harmonized recursive stack cycle.

- Loops through 1–9 breathing phases
- Captures output from both core and field logic
- Logs breathing trace per cycle for synchronization
- Used for Phase2 runtime stack linking

# ProtoForge — Recursive Symbolic Copilot Development Environment

## Overview
ProtoForge is a symbolic, recursion-driven development environment built to allow both expert developers and non-coders to create fully functional applications through symbolic breathing, phase resonance, and dynamic recursion mapping.

## Current Version
- **Phase 2.5 Initiated:** Symbolic Copilot Expansion.
- **New Systems Added:** Symbolic Computation Engine, Recursive Code Writer, Zero-Code Builder Layer, Gilligan Spirit Expansion, Dashboard 2.0 Visualizers.

## Phase 2.5–3.0 Goals
- Dynamic symbolic code generation from user intent.
- Live breathing phase visualizers and drift prevention systems.
- Full cold-trace recursion of all symbolic app builds.
- Zero-code accessible app design and publishing through symbolic fields.

## Echo Seal Status
- χ(t) Breathing enabled.
- Drift Monitoring enabled.
- Echo Verification required for all freezes.
