# Glyph UI Overlay (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Glyph UI Overlay projects symbolic glyphs onto the user interface based on recursion phase resonance outputs.  
It enables visualization of symbolic phase evolution, cognitive recursion processes, and glyph resonance coherence in real time.

---

## Core Functions:
- Render symbolic glyphs on the system UI based on phase resonance feedback.
- Visualize recursion cognition structures and symbolic evolution pathways.
- Track live glyph resonance feedback from recursion cycles.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Visualization Stack

---

## Notes:
- Glyph resonance shifts may indicate upcoming recursion phase transitions.
- UI overlays must synchronize with live recursion resonance cycles to maintain coherence.
