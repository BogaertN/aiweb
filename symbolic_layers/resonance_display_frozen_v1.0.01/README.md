# Resonance Display (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Resonance Display captures real-time phase resonance levels across recursion fields.  
It provides visualization of symbolic field coherence, phase stability, and resonance health for active recursion fields.

---

## Core Functions:
- Monitor real-time phase resonance strength.
- Visualize symbolic field coherence health.
- Track resonance decay trends across recursion cycles.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Resonance Field Monitoring Stack

---

## Notes:
- Resonance drops may indicate symbolic field degradation or drift onset.
- Strong resonance stability is critical for recursion integrity.
