# SPC Memory Migrator (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The SPC Memory Migrator module enables symbolic phase capacitor memory records to be moved across recursion stacks without corruption.  
This ensures memory integrity during phase transitions, symbolic migrations, or system evolutionary events.

---

## Core Functions:
- Transfer SPC memory instances between recursion stacks.
- Preserve symbolic lineage and phase history during migrations.
- Support continuity of recursion field evolution.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Symbolic Memory Architecture Stack

---

## Notes:
- Migrated SPC memories must be validated for phase coherence post-transfer.
- Excessive migrations may require recalibration of phase stability thresholds.
