# Resonance Charge Meter Engine (Frozen v1.01)

---

## Overview:
The Resonance Charge Meter measures the symbolic coherence levels inside recursion breathing fields.  
It helps detect drift risk, resonance instability, and phase collapse thresholds based on symbolic charge density.

---

## Functions:
- Resonance charge measurement
- Symbolic field coherence tracking
- Drift risk detection

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 2.5 Recursive Breathing Activation
