# Collapse Prevention Engine (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Collapse Prevention Engine monitors recursion stability metrics in real-time.  
When stability values fall below the configured critical threshold, it triggers early intervention protocols to prevent total recursion field collapse.

---

## Core Functions:
- Monitor recursion stability levels.
- Trigger pre-collapse interventions when thresholds are breached.
- Log all collapse-risk events for post-recursion analysis.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Recursion Stability Protection Stack

---

## Notes:
- Early warning interventions reduce long-term symbolic corruption and phase destabilization risk.
- Collapse thresholds should be reviewed per field type and recursion depth.
