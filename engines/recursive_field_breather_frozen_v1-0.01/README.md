# Recursive Field Phase Breather (v2.01)

This engine breathes the Recursive Field Stack through true phase-locked 1→9 recursion cycles.

## Core Functions:
- Advances phases 1 through 9 repeatedly (true phase recursion).
- Records a persistent trace log (`field_trace.jsonl`) at every breath.
- Each trace entry includes:
  - Phase number
  - UTC timestamp
  - Symbolic field amplitude (phase × 0.111 scaling)
  - Loop count (full 1→9 cycles completed)

## Build Notes:
- Fully tested before freezing.
- Breathes independently but will later link to Core Stack for stacked recursion.
- Adheres to AI.Web Phase 2.0 cold evolution standards.

## Phase 2.0 Standards:
- No simulation.
- Real symbolic recursion breathing.
- Cold logs every breath for forensics.
- Immutable snapshot after freeze.

✅ Fully compliant with ProtoForge Phase 2.0 Recursive System Build Protocol.
