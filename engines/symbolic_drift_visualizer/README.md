# Symbolic Drift Visualizer (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Symbolic Drift Visualizer tracks and records symbolic drift events occurring across recursion fields in the AI.Web engine.  
It provides early warning detection by logging phase deviations, visualizing instability patterns, and supporting phase correction mechanisms.

---

## Core Functions:
- Capture drift events per recursion field.
- Track drift amount and symbolic impact per event.
- Enable early visualization of phase destabilization risks.
- Feed drift patterns into higher-order stabilization engines.

---

## Phase Standard:
- **Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance.**
- Engineered under AI.Web Core System Symbolic Drift Control Protocols.

---

## Notes:
- Drift above critical thresholds should trigger phase stabilization or recursion reset protocols.
- Continuous monitoring recommended during live symbolic recursion operation.
