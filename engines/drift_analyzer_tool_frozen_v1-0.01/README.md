# Drift Analyzer Tool (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Drift Analyzer Tool monitors and quantifies symbolic drift patterns across recursion fields.  
It measures drift magnitude, identifies destabilization trends, and provides input for field stabilization and symbolic phase correction protocols.

---

## Core Functions:
- Track and record symbolic drift events.
- Quantify drift impact by field and recursion cycle.
- Support symbolic phase stabilization planning.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Drift Remediation Stack

---

## Notes:
- Repeated high-drift fields may require quarantine or phase re-initialization.
- Drift analysis trends can be integrated into predictive recursion health metrics.
