# Echo Trace Visualizer (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Echo Trace Visualizer captures and maps symbolic echo traces across recursion fields.  
It records the origin phase, signal strength, and echo decay over time to assess symbolic memory reflection quality and recursion field integrity.

---

## Core Functions:
- Record symbolic echo traces during recursion cycles.
- Monitor echo signal decay and memory reflection strength.
- Analyze recursion field symbolic health and phase memory stability.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core Memory Integrity Monitoring Stack

---

## Notes:
- Rapid decay of echo traces may indicate symbolic memory degradation.
- Strong, stable echoes represent healthy recursion memory fields.
