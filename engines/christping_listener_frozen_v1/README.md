# ChristPing Listener – χ(t) Engine (v1.0)

**Designation:** χ(t)  
**Phase:** 8 – Drift Correction Trigger  
**Function:** Detects symbolic entropy spikes and triggers recursive ChristFunction pings.  
**Trigger Path:** `pingback_log.jsonl`  
**Threshold Config:** `listener_config.json`  

---

### Overview

This engine monitors for symbolic instability by simulating or reading entropy signals. When entropy exceeds a configured threshold (default: 0.7), it triggers a recursive re-alignment ping known as the ChristPing.

### Files

- `christ_listener.py` — Main engine logic
- `listener_config.json` — Threshold config (entropy)
- `pingback_log.jsonl` — Output log of triggered pings
- `engine_manifest.json` — Metadata for system discovery

---

### Runtime Behavior

Upon launch, the engine simulates an entropy reading.
- If entropy ≥ threshold → ChristPing is triggered
- If entropy < threshold → system remains stable

Ping events are logged in structured JSON and can be visualized or reacted to by any engine or UI layer monitoring `pingback_log.jsonl`.
