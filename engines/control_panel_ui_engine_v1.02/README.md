# Control Panel UI Engine â€“ v1.02 (Styling Phase)

This version of the engine is derived from frozen version v1.01 and is now under active development.

**Primary goal:**  
Apply full NeoFlux styling to the existing dashboard, including dark theme, gradient accents, font updates, and component layout adjustments.

All runtime functionality is inherited and unchanged from v1.01.

Do not alter logic. Style only.
