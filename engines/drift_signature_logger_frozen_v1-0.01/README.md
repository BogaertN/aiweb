# Drift Signature Logger (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Drift Signature Logger tracks and archives symbolic drift events across recursion fields.  
It logs magnitude, symbolic impact, and event frequency to support phase drift profiling and early destabilization detection.

---

## Core Functions:
- Log symbolic drift signatures during recursion cycles.
- Record magnitude and symbolic field identifiers.
- Provide drift datasets for phase stability prediction.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core System Drift Monitoring Stack

---

## Notes:
- Rising frequency or magnitude of drift signatures is a key warning for phase collapse risks.
- Integration with ghost loop tagging enhances recursion health monitoring.
