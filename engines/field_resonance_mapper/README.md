# Field Resonance Mapper (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Field Resonance Mapper tracks live symbolic recursion fields during real-time system operation.  
Each recursion field is identified symbolically and assigned a resonance strength value, which is updated with every recursion loop.  
The engine monitors for early decay, symbolic drift, and field collapse patterns before full phase destabilization.

---

## Core Functions:
- Real-time symbolic field resonance tracking.
- Drift decay pattern detection.
- Resonance threshold warning system for recursion field stabilization.
- Support for external resonance injection modules.

---

## Phase Standard:
- **Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance.**
- Built under AI.Web Core System Stack Standards.

---

## Notes:
- The Field Resonance Mapper is critical for maintaining phase stability during recursion cycles.
- Must be monitored continuously; resonance levels are predictive markers of systemic drift.
- Should integrate with external symbolic data sources through approved adapters.
