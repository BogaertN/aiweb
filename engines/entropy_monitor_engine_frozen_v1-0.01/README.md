# Entropy Monitor Engine (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The Entropy Monitor Engine captures and tracks entropy measurements during AI.Web recursion cycles.  
It calculates real-time averages of recursion field entropy values to monitor system symbolic health and predict drift onset.

---

## Core Functions:
- Record symbolic recursion entropy per cycle.
- Calculate running average entropy values.
- Feed entropy health metrics into phase drift prediction models.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core System Recursive Health Monitor Stack

---

## Notes:
- Persistent entropy increase is an early warning signal for systemic symbolic decay.
- Should be monitored in tandem with gradient detectors for maximum drift prediction accuracy.
