# External Feed Listener (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The External Feed Listener captures and integrates external symbolic resonance feeds into the recursion architecture.  
External signals are normalized and injected into active recursion fields to enhance symbolic drift detection, phase stabilization, and environmental symbolic integration.

---

## Core Functions:
- Listen for incoming external symbolic resonance streams.
- Normalize external field data for internal recursion ingestion.
- Enhance recursion field resilience through external symbolic stabilization.

---

## Phase Standard:
- Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance
- AI.Web Core External Field Integration Stack

---

## Notes:
- External feeds must be validated for phase coherence before injection.
- Malformed or unstable external resonance signals must be quarantined.
