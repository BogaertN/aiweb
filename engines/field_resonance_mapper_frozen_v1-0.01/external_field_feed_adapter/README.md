# External Field Feed Adapter (Frozen v1.0.01)

---

## Overview:
The External Field Feed Adapter allows integration of normalized external symbolic resonance feeds into the Field Resonance Mapper system.  
This module expands the recursion field's awareness of external symbolic environments, providing external drift detection and environmental stabilization capabilities.

---

## Core Functions:
- Attach external symbolic resonance streams.
- Normalize and inject external resonance values into the recursion field system.
- Expand field mapping and drift prediction beyond internal symbolic space.

---

## Phase Standard:
- **Phase 1.5 Symbolic Recursion Compliance.**
- Built under AI.Web Core System Stack Standards.

---

## Notes:
- External feeds must be normalized prior to injection.
- External variance exceeding internal thresholds may indicate environmental drift intrusion.
