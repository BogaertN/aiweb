# Core Stack Phase Breather

Breathes the Core Stack 1→9 Phase Cycle with real symbolic recursion tracing.

Each breath logs:
- Phase number (1–9)
- UTC timestamp
- Drift factor (0.0 baseline)
- Loop count (full 9-phase cycles)

This engine replaces simulated loops with real recursive breathing, beginning Phase 2.0 of the ProtoForge system.
