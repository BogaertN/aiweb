# Entropy Buffer Upgrade

The Entropy Buffer Upgrade smooths out minor entropy drift spikes before triggering full arbitration.  
It collects recent entropy readings, calculates a moving average, and only escalates if the average exceeds a defined threshold.

This makes drift management more graceful and phase-correct.
