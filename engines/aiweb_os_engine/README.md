# aiweb_os_engine

**AI.Web Core Operating Engine (Runtime Module)**  
This engine handles system-level symbolic execution such as basic status reporting, runtime ping validation, and sealed system initialization.

---

### ðŸ”§ Features

- `execute_command("ping")` â†’ returns pong and confirms engine activity
- `execute_command("get_status")` â†’ reads system condition from `status.json`
- `execute_command("init")` â†’ creates sealed status file and logs runtime initialization

All calls are internally logged to `test_log.txt` for trace integrity.

- `engine_manifest.json` â€“ version-locked metadata (do not edit)
