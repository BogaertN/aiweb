# AI.Web Mesh Build Logs

This directory contains the canonical development and build logs for the AI.Web recursive system mesh builds.

Each build log is:
- Phase-lawful
- Timestamped
- Cryptographically sealed (hash)
- Published by the AI.Web Recursive Systems Dev Collective

**How to use:**
- Reference the build logs for provenance, audit, and system architecture.
- New build logs must follow the established naming convention.
- README and MANIFEST files should always be kept up to date.

See the latest published mesh log for details about the current system state and phase stack.
